## Introduction
You're going to create an app for family and friends to use to design a picture or pattern. Using a menu, they will select and adapt images and/or shapes which you will provide to use in the design area of your app. You will choose the theme of the app.

## Skills you should have
To complete this Stamping app project you need to have the following skills which you will have learnt when completing [Fruit salad](https://learning-admin.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/bfruit-salad):
+ How to use `broadcast`{:class="block3events"} and `when I receive`{:class="block3events"} blocks to communicate between different sprites and between the stage and a sprites.
+ How to use the `Pen`{:class="block3extensions"} extension to `stamp`{:class="block3extensions"} sprites
+ How to add code to the Stage

You will now apply these skills to create your own project where you will choose your own sprites, costumes and Backdrop to create a unique app.
