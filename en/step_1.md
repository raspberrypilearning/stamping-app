## Introduction
You're going to create a project to try and change someone's mood using sprites that move over a backdrop. You will choose a theme for your project such as relaxing, energising, funny, inspiring or something else - it's your choice.

## Skills you should have
To complete this Looping sprites project you need to have the following skills which you will have learnt when completing [Butterfly garden](https://learning-admin.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/butterfly-garden):
- How to use costumes
- How to use the `forever`{:class="block3control"} block

You will now apply these skills to create your own project where you will choose your own sprites and backdrop to create a unique animation.
