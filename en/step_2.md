## Choose your theme
Now it's time to think about your project. What app will you make? You need to make a Stamping app for users to develop their own designs. The theme, the menu and the costumes are up to you.

Get ideas for your own Stamping app project by investigating projects created by others. 

--- task ---
Go to the [Stamping app](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/27160618){:target="_blank"} Scratch studio.

Click 'See inside' to investigate how the projects were made. The costumes in the Ingredients sprite offers different graphics which the user can choose from to make up their picture or pattern. The menu enables the user to adapt the graphics such as grow, shrink, colour change, flip horizontal, flip vertical, ghost etc - what the menu offers is your choice.

**Tip:** An easy way to create a complex design or pattern is to make many simple modifications to a graphic's size, colour, saturation and facing direction.
