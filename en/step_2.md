## Get inspiration

You are going to create a stamping app which will allow users to develop their own designs. The theme, menu and costumes are up to you.

You can get ideas for your own stamping app project by investigating projects created by others.

Have a look at the [Stamping app](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/27160618){:target="_blank"} projects below from the Raspberry Pi Foundation Scratch studio.

In each, clicking the top menu sprite changes the sprite's costume and other buttons offer different graphic effects such as grow, shrink, colour change, flip horizontal, flip vertical, ghost etc - what the menu offers is your choice.

Click the green flag on a project to see the code run.

Click `See inside`{:class="block3motion"} below a project to investigate its code. Each sprite has a different **algorithm** which makes each sprite's movement unique.

**Tip:** Professional programmers explore and take inspiration from code created by other programmers.
