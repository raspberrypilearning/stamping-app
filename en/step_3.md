## Get a sprite moving
First it is time to design you app interface.

--- task ---
This sprite moves up and down the stage, changing direction when it hits the top or bottom. 

--- no-print ---
![Animated gif showing path of sprite](images/moving-up-down.gif){:width="400px"}
--- /no-print ---

--- print-only ---
![Image annotated with path of sprite](images/moving-up-down.png){:width="400px"}
--- /print-only ---

Here's the code it uses:

```blocks3
when flag clicked
set rotation style [don't rotate v]
point in direction (0)
set size to (100) %
forever
move (5) steps
if on edge, bounce
end
```

Look at the code and understand how it makes the sprite move.

Choosing `0` in the `point in direction`{:class="block3motion"} block makes the sprite point upwards so the `move`{:class="block3motion"} block will make the sprite move up to the top of the stage. If the sprite touches the top of the Stage it will flip direction and start moving down towards the bottom of the stage.

Think about how you want your sprite to move. For example, you might say "I want my sprite to move up and down the stage really slowly." or "I want my sprite to be really small and move quickly in a diagonal line."

Select your first sprite and click on the Code tab.

Add code to make your sprite move around the stage in a forever loop, bouncing off the edges of the stage.

Change the speed and direction of your sprite to get the effect you want.

You may need to change the way your sprite's costume rotates when it moves to stop it going upside down.

Is your sprite the size you want it to be? If not, adjust its size.

**Add me in: generic-scratch-change-size **

--- /task ---

**Tip:** It's easier to identify issues if you make one change at a time and then run your program.

Remember to keep running your project to test it. Is the program working as you had planned?
