## App interface
First it's time to design your graphical user interface (GUI) for the Stamping app. The GUI will includes the menu - ingredients and buttons - as well as the design area of the window where the user will create their design.

--- task ---
Design your interface.

Think about what you want the graphical user interface to look like.
How much space will you need for the menu?
What buttons do you need? You will make them in the next step  but you need enough space for them when you are planning.
Do you want to add a graphic and/or colour to the design area?

Go to the Backdrops tab and create a design area for your interface using graphics and/or colour.

--- task ---
Select the Code tab for the Backdrop.

--- /task ---

--- task ---
Add this simple code for the Backdrop:

```blocks3
when stage clicked
broadcast [add v]
```
Look at the code and understand how it works.

**Add me in: generic-broadcast **

Now create a sprite called Menu. Go to Choose a Sprite and select Paint to access the Paint Editor.

**Add me in: generic-ChooseaSprite/Paint **

--- /task ---

--- task ---
In the Paint Editor create a menu. In the examples given, a plain white rectangle has been used. The menu should not include any buttons.

--- /task ---

--- task ---
Set the menu to Backward so that the menu will always sit behind the buttons you create.

**Add me in: generic-painteditor/arrangeforwardORbackward**

--- /task ---

Sprites automatically sit on top of Backdrop so the menu will sit on top of the Backdrop that you have created. 

The menu sprite needs no code.

--- task ---

At the stage you may need to reposition the menu to one side of the Backdrop's design area or make the interface's design area larger or smaller.
