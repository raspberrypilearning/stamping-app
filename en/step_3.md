## App interface
First it's time to design your Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the Stamping app. For your app, the GUI will include a menu with ingredients (pictures and/or patterns) and buttons as well as the design area of the window where the user will create their picture or pattern.

--- task ---
Design your interface.

Think about what you want the graphical user interface to look like.
How much space will you need for the menu?
What buttons do you need? You will make them in the next step but you need to plan enough space for the buttons.
Do you want to add a graphic and/or colour to the design area?

Go to the Backdrops tab and create a design area for your interface using graphics and/or colour.

--- task ---
Select the Code tab for the Backdrop.

Add this simple code for the Backdrop:

```blocks3
when stage clicked
broadcast [add v]
```
Look at the code and understand how it works.

Now create a sprite called Menu. Go to Choose a Sprite and select Paint to access the Paint Editor.

**Add me in: generic-ChooseaSprite/Paint **

--- /task ---

--- task ---
In the Paint Editor, create a menu. In the examples given, a plain white rectangle has been used. The menu should not include any buttons.

--- /task ---

--- task ---
Set the menu to Backward so that the menu will always sit behind the buttons you create.

**Add me in: generic-painteditor/arrangeforwardORbackward**

--- /task ---

Sprites automatically sit on top of Backdrops so the menu will sit on top of the Backdrop that you have created. 

The menu sprite needs no code.

--- task ---

At this stage, you may need to reposition the menu to one side of the Backdrop's design area or make the interface's design area larger or smaller.
