## Buttons
Now its time to create buttons. What do your buttons need to do? Grow, shrink, flip horizontally, flip vertically, ghost?

Go to the [Stamping app](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/27160618){:target="_blank"} Scratch studio.

Explore the buttons used in the projects. Click 'See inside' to investigate how the code for the buttons works.

--- task ---
Choose or create in Paint Editor a sprite for each button you need. Don't forget to add an icon on the button so the user understands visually the buttons effect.

**Tip:** There are some useful button graphics in Scratch - search for buttons in Choose a Sprite.

Click on the Code tab of each button and add the following code. Don't forget to add a easy to recognise message for the broadcast i.e if the button flips the image then call the message flip etc.:

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
broadcast [New message  v]
```
