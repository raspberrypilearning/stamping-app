## Buttons
Now its time to create buttons. What do your buttons need to do? Grow, shrink, flip horizontally, flip vertically, ghost?

Choose or create in Paint Editor a sprite for each button you need. Don't forget to add an icon on the button so the user understands visually the buttons effect.

**Tip:** There are some useful button graphics in Scratch - search for buttons in Choose a Sprite.

Click on the Code tab of each of the button sprite and add the following code. On each of the button sprite, don't forget to add a New message to the broadcast which is easy to understand i.e if the button flips the costume then call the message flip etc.:

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
broadcast [New message  v]
```
