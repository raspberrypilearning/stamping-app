## Share your project

If you are in a club, why not demonstrate your project to friends and peers?

If you are at home, try the project out with your family. 

If you have a Scratch account you can share your project through Scratch. Then you can send a link to people you know and the whole Scratch community will be able to find your project and try it out.

Why not invite your friends to create a project? Let them know how you had fun.


Project 6: As well as contributing to Scratch studios, you can also make your project public which means anyone anywhere can experience it. Scratch allows other users to copy and modify your original project by ‘remixing’ it.

If users do remix your project, their copy automatically recognises your initial creativity. Many programmers allow others to work with their programs. This is referred to as ‘open-source’. It’s a easy way to improve their program. They also feel good being part of a global community. Some well-know applications have been developed by an open-source community.
