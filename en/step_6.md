## Share your project

If you are in a club, why not demonstrate your project to friends and peers?

If you are at home, try the project out with your family. 

If you have a Scratch account you can share your project through Scratch. On your projectsâ€™s Project Page, complete the Instructions, Notes and Credits in the spaces provided. This will help others to engage with your project. Leave commenting on.

Then you can send a link to people you know and the whole Scratch community will be able to find, play and comment on your project.

By sharing your Scratch projects, you become part of a community. Others can comment on your project and you can test and support others by commenting on their projects as well. Never share your personal information online.

Keep an eye out for comments that others may make about your creation. Feedback is a great way to reflect on your work. Ignore any comments which are negative or irrelevant.

Encourage others with Scratch accounts to leave comments about your creation.
