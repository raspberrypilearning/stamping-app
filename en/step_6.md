## Share your project

If you are in a club, why not demonstrate your project to friends and peers?

If you are at home, try the project out with your family. 

If you have a Scratch account you can share your Stamping app project through Scratch. Then you can send a link to people you know and the whole Scratch community will be able to find your project and try it out. 

Encourage others with Scratch accounts to leave comments about your creation.

By making your project public, anyone anywhere can experience it. Scratch allows other users to copy and modify your original project by ‘remixing’ it.

If they do remix your project, their copy automatically recognises your initial creativity by crediting you.

Many programmers allow others to work with their programs. This is referred to as ‘open-source’. Programmers share their code for a number of reasons. They feel good being part of a global community. It’s also an easy way to improve their program as other programmers always come up with different, and sometimes improved, solutions. Some well-know applications have been developed by an open-source community.

Why not invite your friends to create a project? Let them know how you had fun.
