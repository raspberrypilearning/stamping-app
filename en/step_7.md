## Reflect on your project
How did you get on with your Stamping app project? What new ideas do you have for making a project?

Remind yourself what you have learned:

--- /task ---
--- task ---
I can use broadcast to communicate between sprites
--- /task ---
--- task ---
I can plan a graphical user interface to help a user navigate an app
--- /task ---
--- task ---
I can work between the code and Sprites and/or Backdrops to make an effective app
--- task ---
I shared my project and learnt from someone else
--- /task ---
--- task ---
I remixed someone else's project
--- /task ---
--- task ---

Demonstrating these skills will contribute to the [Scratch Beginner]() and [Citizen Maker]() badges. 

You can go back and improve your project whenever you have time.
