## Reflect on your project
How did you get on with your Looping sprites project? Is there anything you would do differently? 

Remind yourself what you have learned:

--- task ---
I can use if on edge, bounce inside a forever loop to make my sprite turn away from the edge of the stage
--- /task ---
--- task ---
I can use a forever loop to make a sprite repeat code 
--- /task ---
--- task ---
I can modify a costume in the paint editor
--- /task ---
--- task ---
My  project uses rotation styles to change how my sprite rotates
--- /task ---
--- task ---
I can use layers to make it look like some sprites are in front of others
--- /task ---
--- task ---

--- /task ---

Demonstrating these skills will contribute to the [Scratch Beginner]() and [Citizen Maker]() badges. 

You can go back and improve your project whenever you have time. 

If you have a Scratch account and have shared your Looping sprites project, keep an eye out for comments that others may make about your creation. Feedback is a great way to reflect on your work. Ignore any comments which are negative or irrelevant.
