## What next?

If you have been following along the Skills projects in the Being Mindful pathway then go back to the next Skills project, [Relax and stretch](https://learning-admin.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/relax-stretch) and begin to use `repeat`{:class="block3control"} in a program.

If you have completed all the Skills projects in the Look After Yourself pathway and are now following the Make it yours projects, then go on to the next project [Same but different](https://learning-admin.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/same-but-different). 

If you want to have more fun exploring Scratch, then you could try out any of [these projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?software%5B%5D=scratch).
